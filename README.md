Analysis of dataset (popular baby names) given by SSA [US]

The above .ipynb file contains my analysis of dataset.

Note:some plots are not loading because of size. You can download the .ipynb file and then put this .ipynb file in the dataset directory and run it on jupyter notebook you will be able to see it.

The notebook itself explains the analysis of the dataset.

Thank You.
